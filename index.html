<p>Zork is an adventure videogame. It was made by college students and it became very popular. Zork, or previously known as dungeons, is an interactive only text adventure game in which your aim is to kill a troll. There is not any much more to say, it is a game that you should experience yourself because it's basically just interacting via text with the game. Click this <a href="http://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2Fzdungeon.z5">link</a> to play the original Zork.</p>

<a id="my-own-zork" class="anchor" href="#my-own-zork" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My own Zork</h1>

<p>My Zork game is settled in a magic world compound of regions from the most well-known fairy tales. It includes regions from, for example, Hansel &amp; Gratel or Snow White among others.</p>

<p>You were doing some programming late at night as usual and fall sleep, you don't know how or why but you ended up in this magic world. You want to get home as soon as possible as you have an exam the next day.</p>

<p>Our journey begins at the yellow brick path were we will find Dorothy, who after talking to her will tell us that she hasn't bring us there, but that perhaps the great Wixard of Oz might know who bring us there and how we could get out of there and return home. She will tell us that if we find any of her friends we should tell them that Dorothy was tired of waiting for them and went to have some tea with a guy with a nice hat she had just met.</p>

<p>So your aim in this game is to meet with the great Wizard of Oz and make him bring you back home.</p>
